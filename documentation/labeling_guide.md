| excellent    | As good as new asphalt, on which a skateboard or rollerblades will have no problem.                                                                                                                                                                                      | ![excellent](imgs/asphalt_excellent.jpg) |
| good         | Asphalt showing the first signs of wear, such as narrow, smaller than 1.5 cm cracks, or wider cracks filled up with tar, shallow dents in which rainwater may collect, which may cause trouble for rollerblades but not for racing bikes.                                  | ![good](imgs/asphalt_good.jpg)          |
| intermediate | Asphalt roads that shows signs of maintenance, such as patches of repaired surface, wider cracks larger than 2cm. Asphalt sidewalks may contain potholes, but these are small, shallow (<3cm deep) and can be easily avoided, asphalt driving lanes shows damage due to subsidence (depressions of a scale >50 cm) or heavy traffic (shallow ruts in asphalt caused by trucks in summer). This means that the road can be used by normal city bikes, wheelchairs and sports cars, but not by a racing bike. | ![intermediate](imgs/asphalt_intermediate.jpg) |
| bad          | Heavily damaged asphalt roads that badly need maintenance: many potholes, some of them quite deep. The average speed of cars is less than 50% of what it would be on a smooth road. However, it isnâ€™t so rough that ground clearance becomes a problem. Meaning that the street causes trouble to normal city bike but not a trekking bike and a car | ![bad](imgs/asphalt_bad.jpg)           |
